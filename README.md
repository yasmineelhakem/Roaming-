# Roaming Subscriber Monitoring Tool

This Django application is designed to monitor and analyze roaming subscribers in both Roaming IN and Roaming OUT scenarios, focusing on data collected from the VLR (Visitor Location Register) and HSS (Home Subscriber Server). The tool aims to improve steering plan management and enhance control over revenues generated by roaming services.

## Features

- **Data Upload**: Upload files extracted from HSS for Roaming IN and Roaming OUT.
- **Automated Data Processing**: Automatically processes the uploaded data to generate statistics.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Provides various visualizations, including histograms and horizontal bar charts, to display VLR and subscriber distribution by country and operator.
- **CSV Output**: Generates CSV files with processed data that can be downloaded for further analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core language used for data processing and analysis.
- **Django**: The web framework used to develop the application, manage forms, and handle file uploads.
- **Plotly & Dash**: Libraries used to create dynamic and interactive visualizations within the app.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation library used for processing and analyzing structured data.
- **phonenumbers**: A library for validating and parsing phone numbers, used to enrich data processing.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight database for storing uploaded files and generated results.
